Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

Sorry for being lazy but I'm back (at least for now ðŸ˜‰).

Ok back to Flutter and Animations, two of my favourite things in frontend development.

{{< rawhtml >}}

    <source src="./videos/animation-full.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Full
  </video>
</center>

{{< /rawhtml >}}

Last year when I was still interning at a company I was asked to build the above animation. It was an interesting but a bit difficult task as the animation had a lot of moving parts and the data inside (amount) will change, hence I cannot use a video or something like that and video would take more space than code. Let me take you through my thought process of building this.

Whenever I think about building an animation I look at this amazing chart by the Flutter team.

[![Which is better approach for an animation in Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/animations/animation-decision-tree.png)](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations)

By looking at this chart you can see that our animation is basically lines and nodes. So it looks like a drawing and I thought it's easy to code it (boy I was so wrong ðŸ¥²). Hence I picked CustomPainter.

Before I go ahead I would like to mention that you can also create a [RenderObject](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject-class.html) in Flutter if you want any of the element to be clickable or have elements which are complex to build with CustomPainter but easier using existing widgets.

Moving on to the how I built this animation -

1. Divide the animation is parts.
1. Build the static components without any animations.
1. Animate those components.
1. Optimize the animation.

### Dividing an animation

It's better to divide a longer an animation into segments, it will make it a lot easier for you to code it and more importantly understand it.

You can divide when the direction of motion, color, or focus (Object which is animating) of animation changes.

> Trust your gut feeling.

When I saw the end state of animation I divided it in 3 sections to focus on.

{{< figure src="./images/animation-end-sectioned.jpg" width="50%" align="center" >}}

1. Red - Main node
1. Blue - edge lines
1. Yellow - Children nodes

1. Tracking Main node's motion

{{< rawhtml >}}

<center>
  <video width="50%" autoplay loop>
    <source src="./videos/animation-1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Full
  </video>
</center>

{{< /rawhtml >}}

We need to move the main node up. It's pretty easy as we just need to move the center of the node and you have your animation.

2. edge lines appear

{{< rawhtml >}}

<center>
  <video width="50%" autoplay loop>
    <source src="./videos/animation-2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Full
  </video>
</center>

{{< /rawhtml >}}

The edge lines appear and shifts attention of the user from main head to it. It's very easy, just change opacity from 0 to 1.

3. Green color flows from main node to edge lines

{{< rawhtml >}}

<center>
  <video width="50%" autoplay loop>
    <source src="./videos/animation-3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Full
  </video>
</center>

{{< /rawhtml >}}

While draining color from main head is simpler but flowing the green in the edge lines is a bit difficult because of the curves.

4. Green color flows from edge lines to children

{{< rawhtml >}}

<center>
  <video width="50%" autoplay loop>
    <source src="./videos/animation-4.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Full
  </video>
</center>

{{< /rawhtml >}}

Again filling green around children is simpler than draining color from edge lines (I used a neat trick here).

### Create static components

Now that we thought about how we are going to split our animation, now we can start creating static components. We should also keep in mind that we need to animate these components so just ensure than you use a variables such that it becomes easier to animate it later.

```dart
// Some constants
const _roundedRectangleRadius = 25.0;
const _padding = 15.0;

const Color darkGreen = Color(0xff1B3C37),
    green = Color(0xff01C36D),
    text = Color(0xffEBECEC),
    primary = Color(0xff2A2136);

// The CustomPainter (where Flutter devs are artists)
class TreeSplitAnimationPainter extends CustomPainter {

  // Getters for paints
  Paint get darkGreenPaint => Paint()
    ..color = darkGreen
    ..strokeWidth = 5
    ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke
    ..strokeCap = StrokeCap.round;

  Paint get greenPaint => Paint()
    ..color = green
    ..strokeWidth = 5
    ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke
    ..strokeCap = StrokeCap.round;

  // Here we need to write our code which will draw stuff on canvas
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Sizes of outlines and nodes
    final rootNodeRadius = size.width / 10;
    final outlineRootNodeRadius = rootNodeRadius + 18;
    final nodeRadius = size.width / 12;
    final outlineNodeRadius = nodeRadius + 15;

    // Painting starts here
  }
}
```

After setting up stuff we can move on to the more interesting part, that is painting on canvas.

Let's start with making the nodes as it's easier and canvas has built in methods for them. We will use [Canvas API](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Canvas-class.html) a lot after this.

#### Making nodes

|                                                    |                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Main node](./images/animation-end-main-node.jpg) | ![Children nodes](./images/animation-end-children-node.jpg) |

When you look at them you can see a filled cicle and an outlined circle. Ignore the connecting edge lines we will get back to it in next section.

For the circles we can use [Canvas.drawCircle](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Canvas/drawCircle.html) by giving it the center, radius and style.

```dart
canvas.drawCircle(center, nodeRadius, circlePaint);
```

Now we can either draw the outline using the same `drawCircle` method and set it to not fill the colors but we need to animate it hence we will use another method called [Canvas.drawArc](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Canvas/drawArc.html)

```dart
canvas.drawArc(
  Rect.fromCircle(center: center, radius: radius), // creates a box in which the circle is formed
  startAngle,         // starting point of arc
  sweepAngle,         // end point of arc
  false,              // `useCenter` = false we don't want to start and end at center
  paint,              // painting instructions
);
```

Don't get scared this feels easier when you start actually doing it.

Now you can use these and make a function to build your node!

```dart
void _paintNode({
  required Canvas canvas,             // thing that will paint
  required Offset center,             // obvi
  required double nodeRadius,         // obvi
  required double outlineNodeRadius,  // obvi
  required double startAngle,         // start angle of the arc
  required double sweepAngle,         // angle at which the arc ends
  required Paint circlePaint,         // instructions to paint your circle
  required Paint outlinePaint,        // outline painting instructions
}) {
  canvas.drawCircle(center, nodeRadius, circlePaint);

  _paintOutlineCircle(
    canvas: canvas,
    startAngle: startAngle,
    sweepAngle: sweepAngle,
    paint: sutlinePaint,
    radius: outlineNodeRadius,
    center: center,
  );
}
```

We will place our nodes later but it will work just perfectly fine. (trust me bro ðŸ™ƒ)

#### Making edge lines

![Edges](./images/animation-end-edges.jpg)

Now we are at the most difficult yet interesting section. To create we can use [Canvas.drawLine](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Canvas/drawLine.html) for straight lines or [Canvas.drawPath](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Canvas/drawPath.html) to define path and then ask it to draw, basically have a pen and draw on canvas.

By looking at the curves we now that we have to use `drawPath` method.

```dart
canvas.drawPath(path, paint);
```

It simply takes `path` and `paint` as input but defining `path` is most complicated.

By looking at the lines we can see that it starts at the same point and then splits in middle then moves in either directions and then ends. We can conclude that we need start, and end points and derive middle start and middle end point from them.

```
mid       =   YofStart + (distance between start and end along Y-axis) / 2
midStart  =   (XofStart, mid)
midEnd    =   (XofEnd, mid)
```

This roughly translates to

```dart
// calculate the point where the line would split
final mid = edgeStart.dy + ((edgeEnd.dy - edgeStart.dy) / 2);
// point where it start to move left/right
final edgeMidStart = Offset(edgeStart.dx, mid);
// point where it start to move down again
final edgeMidEnd = Offset(edgeEnd.dx, mid);
```

Ahh... we can finally create our lines as we have everything we need, now we can jump into [Path APIs](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Path-class.html). Think it as we are drawing with a pen.

We need to move our pen to the starting point

```dart
path.moveTo(edgeStart.dx, edgeStart.dy)
```

Then move to the mid start point while drawing a line

```dart
path.lineTo(edgeMidStart.dx, edgeMidStart.dy)
```

Then draw till the mid end point

```dart
path.lineTo(edgeMidEnd.dx, edgeMidEnd.dy)
```

Then finally we can end at end point

```dart
path.lineTo(edgeEnd.dx, edgeEnd.dy)
```

Looks simple enough? You can write it using [cascade operator](https://dart.dev/language/operators#cascade-notation) in Dart.

```dart
final edgePath = Path()
  // start
  ..moveTo(edgeStart.dx, edgeStart.dy)
  // to mid start
  ..lineTo(edgeMidStart.dx, edgeMidStart.dy)
  // to mid end
  ..lineTo(edgeMidEnd.dx, edgeMidEnd.dy)
  // to end
  ..lineTo(edgeEnd.dx, edgeEnd.dy);
```

Now it looks more readable as well and we have something that looks like this...

![Edge lines without curves](./images/animation-edge-not-curved.jpg)

Looks good but we can do better, lets add those curves.

Whenever you see a curve you can draw them with a [BÃ©zier curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve). For this case we are going to use [Quadratic BÃ©zier curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve#:~:text=Quadratic%20B%C3%A9zier%20curves%5Bedit%5D).

{{< figure src="./images/quadratic-curve.png" width="20%" align="center" caption="Quadratic BÃ©zier curves" >}}

Flutter has [Path.quadraticBezierTo](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Path/quadraticBezierTo.html) which take two co-ordinate points - control and end point. It starts with the last point to the end point controlled by a control point.

So the plan it to start a bit before the actual line ends and start before the actual line starts.

![Edge lines with point of curve dots](./images/animation-edge-not-curved-curves-points.jpg)

We can see that we need to -

- Start curve 1 before just before we reach _mid start_ and end it before we reach _mid end_
- Start curve 2 before just before we reach _mid end_ and end it just after _mid end_

Our code should look like -

```dart
final edgePath = Path()
  // start
  ..moveTo(edgeStart.dx, edgeStart.dy)
  // to mid start
  ..lineTo(edgeMidStart.dx, edgeMidStart.dy)  // early end this
  // to mid end
  // *curve 1 here*
  ..lineTo(edgeMidEnd.dx, edgeMidEnd.dy)      // late start and early end this
  // to end
  // *curve 2 here*
  ..lineTo(edgeEnd.dx, edgeEnd.dy);           // late start this
```

In flutter `quadraticBezierTo` takes 4 parameters.

```dart
path.quadraticBezierTo(
  controlX,
  controlY,
  endX,
  endY,
)
```

I know, I also hate this API.

```dart
final edgePath = Path()
  ..moveTo(edgeStart.dx, edgeStart.dy)
  ..lineTo(
    edgeMidStart.dx,
    edgeMidStart.dy - _roundedRectangleRadius,  // early end
  )
  ..quadraticBezierTo(
    edgeMidStart.dx,
    edgeMidStart.dy,
    edgeMidStart.dx + _roundedRectangleRadius,  // late start
    edgeMidStart.dy,
  )
  ..lineTo(
    edgeMidEnd.dx -_roundedRectangleRadius,     // early end
    edgeMidEnd.dy,
  )
  ..quadraticBezierTo(
    edgeMidEnd.dx,
    edgeMidEnd.dy,
    edgeMidEnd.dx,
    edgeMidEnd.dy + _roundedRectangleRadius,    // late start
  )
  ..lineTo(
    edgeEnd.dx,
    edgeEnd.dy,
  );
```

This will give you just the right side to get left side you just need to modify a few things.

```dart
final edgePath = Path()
...
  ..quadraticBezierTo(
    edgeMidStart.dx,
    edgeMidStart.dy,
+   edgeMidStart.dx + (isLeft ? -_roundedRectangleRadius : _roundedRectangleRadius),
-   edgeMidStart.dx + _roundedRectangleRadius,
    edgeMidStart.dy,
  )
  ..lineTo(
+   edgeMidEnd.dx - (isLeft ? _roundedRectangleRadius : -_roundedRectangleRadius),
-   edgeMidEnd.dx -_roundedRectangleRadius,
    edgeMidEnd.dy,
  )
...
```

Finally we can paint it using our `drawPath` method on `Path`.

```dart
canvas.drawPath(edgePath, greenPaint);
```

Creating a method for this would look like -

```dart
void _paintEdge({
  required Canvas canvas,
  required Offset edgeStart,
  required Offset edgeEnd,
  bool isLeft = false,
}) {
  // calculate the point where the line would split
  final mid = edgeStart.dy + ((edgeEnd.dy - edgeStart.dy) / 2);
  // point where it start to move left/right
  final edgeMidStart = Offset(edgeStart.dx, mid);
  // point where it start to move down again
  final edgeMidEnd = Offset(edgeEnd.dx, mid);

  final edgePath = Path()
    // Move to the starting point
    ..moveTo(edgeStart.dx, edgeStart.dy)
    // Make a straight line to the mid leaving space for curve
    ..lineTo(
      edgeMidStart.dx,
      edgeMidStart.dy - _roundedRectangleRadius,
    )
    // the curve
    ..quadraticBezierTo(
      edgeMidStart.dx,
      edgeMidStart.dy,
      edgeMidStart.dx + (isLeft ? -_roundedRectangleRadius : _roundedRectangleRadius),
      edgeMidStart.dy,
    )
    // Line which moves horizontally again leaving space for curve
    ..lineTo(
      edgeMidEnd.dx + (isLeft ? _roundedRectangleRadius : -_roundedRectangleRadius),
      edgeMidEnd.dy,
    )
    // Another curve
    ..quadraticBezierTo(
      edgeMidEnd.dx,
      edgeMidEnd.dy,
      edgeMidEnd.dx,
      edgeMidEnd.dy + _roundedRectangleRadius,
    )
    // Stretch line to the end
    ..lineTo(
      edgeEnd.dx,
      edgeEnd.dy,
    );

  // Paint the base dark green color
  canvas.drawPath(edgePath, darkGreenPaint);
}
```

#### Placing the components

For simplicity of code I'm moving the canvas center from top left to top center by the [Canvas.translate](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Canvas/translate.html)

Let's take our main node as the reference point to so that things makes sense.

It will be a bit below the top center hence the following code -

```dart
@override
void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
  ...

  // Center canvas horizontally as it becomes easier to make all measurements
  canvas.translate(size.width / 2, 0);

  // Point where you want the root node to be at end (top-center)
  final start = Offset(0, outlineRootNodeRadius);

  _paintNode(
    canvas: canvas,
    center: start,
    nodeRadius: rootNodeRadius,
    outlineNodeRadius: outlineRootNodeRadius,
    startAngle: math.pi / 2,
    sweepAngle: math.pi * 2,
    circlePaint: Paint()..color = green,
    initialOutlinePaint: darkGreenPaint..color = darkGreen,
    sweepOutlinePaint: greenPaint..color = green,
  );

  ...
}
```

```dart
@override
void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
  ...

  // Start point of edge
  final edgeStart = start + Offset(0, outlineRootNodeRadius);

  // Note: we will calculate only for right node and for left we will negate it

  // end point of the edge
  final edgeEnd = edgeStart +
      Offset(
        // adding padding to have distance between 2 children
        outlineNodeRadius + _padding,
        // how much space child will need from the bottom
        size.height - (outlineNodeRadius * 2) - edgeStart.dy - _padding,
      );

  // position of child node
  final childNode = edgeEnd + Offset(0, outlineNodeRadius);

  // Right edge
  _paintEdge(
    canvas: canvas,
    edgeStart: edgeStart,
    edgeEnd: edgeEnd,
  );
  _paintNode(
    canvas: canvas,
    center: childNode,
    nodeRadius: nodeRadius,
    outlineNodeRadius: outlineNodeRadius,
    startAngle: -math.pi / 2,
    sweepAngle: math.pi * 2,
    circlePaint: Paint()..color = primary,
    initialOutlinePaint: darkGreenPaint,
    sweepOutlinePaint: greenPaint,
  );

  // Left edge
  _paintEdge(
    canvas: canvas,
    edgeStart: edgeStart,
    edgeEnd: edgeEnd.scale(-1, 1),          // negate on x-axis
    isLeft: true,
  );
  _paintNode(
    canvas: canvas,
    center: childNode.scale(-1, 1),         // negate on x-axis
    nodeRadius: nodeRadius,
    outlineNodeRadius: outlineNodeRadius,
    startAngle: -math.pi / 2,
    sweepAngle: math.pi * 2,
    circlePaint: Paint()..color = primary,
    initialOutlinePaint: darkGreenPaint,
    sweepOutlinePaint: greenPaint,
  );
}
```

Finally after sooooo much efforts we are able to create a static painting on our canvas.

Now we can move to the more difficult part that is animating it.

### Animating the components
