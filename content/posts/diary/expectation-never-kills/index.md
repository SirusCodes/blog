# Introduction

I always see someone saying "Expectation kills", "I have stopped expecting anything from anyone". If someone gave a rupee if someone said this to me then trust me I would live in Antilia ðŸ˜‚

Let's start with what do you mean by expectation. Doing a [Google Search](https://www.google.com/search?q=expectation+meaning) on the meaning of expectation will result you into this answer:

> expectation: a strong belief that something will happen or be the case.

Coming back to point, everytime someone said this to me I always used to think "How does expectation kills?", "Can you ever stop expecting?".

## Why this blog?

I have discussed this thing with almost all my friends over the years and it has helped me to formed a really strong opinion about this.

But the idea of writing this as a blog came when [Dheeraj](https://twitter.com/DhiruCodes/) replied this on Twitter.

{{< tweet user="DhiruCodes" id="1569659925621788672" >}}

Nothing wrong here but "Expectations hurt anyways.", this line almost triggered me. Nothing against [Tushar](https://twitter.com/tusharnankanii) he might have different experience than mine and anyone of you readers want to **discuss** this topic with me I'm always up for such discussion you can contact me on any of the medium from [links.darshanrander.com](https://links.darshanrander.com)

# Root cause

The phrase "Expectation kills" is not something that I have heard from one or two people, its from almost all of them whom I have talked about this topic.

Again a quick [Google Search](https://www.google.com/search?q=expectation+kills) on "Expectation kills" will give a lot of articles, discussions and quotes. I read a few of them:

- [Why expectation kills happiness?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/expectation-happiness-killer-phil-nayna/)
- [Why does expectation kill?](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-expectation-kill)

Whatever in it is not wrong, so what's all the fuss about?

And if you have guessed it. Its [not from Shakespeare](https://www.quora.com/Is-this-phrase-from-Shakespeare-Expectation-is-the-root-of-all-heartache).

In these times when Internet is so cheap and our minds are so empty that we just take anything and everything what someone says and just believe its true without thinking about it for a second time.

# Over expectation is a problem

In the sea of all the "Expectation kills" I found this quote floating on top.

{{< figure src="images/overexpectation-kills.jpg" alt="Over expectation kills your happiness" height="300px" >}}

This is what I feel. You can never stop **EXPECTING**.

Let's take one of my favourite example - You are **not** overexpecting when you think I should treat you in a good way. But you **are** overexpecting when you think that I should give you all my life's saving (I don't have any saving but you get the idea)

Now while writing this blog I was talking to another friend about it and she said "I have experience with very low expectations disappointingÂ me".

So, is expecting really a problem?

## Expectation vs Over-expectation

"Atleast we can expect this from them?", I'm sure everyone of us had said this in some or the other way. But can we decide what we can expect and cannot? Often we think that we are already expecting less from the other person. This is one of the main reason why we get _hurt_.

The answer is not black or white here but I will try. So surely we can decide if we can expect something from someone but keeping in mind how strong you bond is from both the ends and how the other person is.

For example - I can expect my bestfriend to listen to all my sad breakup stories (They enjoy the trauma in my life ðŸ˜‚). But at the same time I cannot expect a stranger to do that for me.

Here I know that my bestfriends care about me and they pretty much enjoy the trauma so I'm sure that they will listen. But a complete stranger might not want to hear all that negativity.

So calculate what you can expect and what you cannot. Its always better to talk and understand the other side before assuming anything from their end.

# Managing expectations

One of the most difficult task is to manage your expectation. We already saw how difficult is to find a line between expectations and over-expectations as it varies from person to person and the bond you have with them. In short there are too many vairables to handle.

I will not lie I don't have answer to how manage expectations? The main reason is because to manage your expectations you have to understand the other person and we all know that **you can never truely understand someone**. Whenever I thought that I truly understand this person. They someone managed to make me realise that I don't. People change with time and situtations.

In my opinion the best way to manage it is by discussing and understanding the other person better and then expecting. But also has its issues.

## All that glitters is not gold

The main issue with getting to an outcome from a discussing is sometimes the other person is not sure if they want or can do something. They might just say things that you want to hear but would themselves never accept. They might do it because of multiple reasons but I feel its mostly think they don't want to hurt your feelings, but that a topic for another blog.

So its better to let other have a margin of error where they fail to meet your expectations.

## Acceptance is the key

Not expecting is not an option. Infact,
{{< rawhtml >}}
<span style="text-decoration:underline; font-weight:bold">You expect more from person who are close to you.</span> {{< /rawhtml >}}

I think that we are built in this way. Whatever lies we tell ourselves that we don't expect anything from anyone but in the end subconsiously we expect a lot from others.

For example - Think about last time when you were felt sad because someone broke your expectations. Did you made those expectations consiously, no right?

So making those expectations is not in our hands, but what we can do is to **accept** it and **move on**. People in our lives will always break our expectations, but we cannot lose a good bond just because we overexpected. The best solution is to accept it and forgive the other person.

## You are not always overexpecting

In the whole blog we were talking about others and how we should manage our expectations with others. But often we forget about ourselves. {{< rawhtml >}}
<span style="text-decoration:underline; font-weight:bold">The most important part of our lives is us.</span> {{< /rawhtml >}}

Not everytime you need to forgive others, sometimes its better to move on from that person and find someone who better understands you.

But when you will know that you are not overexpecting? In my opinion its when you feel hard to forgive someone.

Having said that I should also mention that not everyone will have same basic expectations. So try to help them understand what your basic expectations are and if see a cannot see a change after that then I feel its time to let them go.

# Conclusion

It has been a topic in my mind from a long time and I would never feel that I completely understand this topic but I have tried shared what I have learnt and felt over the years.

I'm sure that there might be some places where you will feel that I'm wrong about something. I would love to talk about you on this. Just ping me any of my social [links](https://links.darshanrander.com)

At the end I would say that managing expectations is very difficult but all you can do it to try and if something goes wrong try to accept and move on but at the same time you should know when it is enough.
