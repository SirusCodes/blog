If someone gave me a rupee if someone said this to me then trust me I would live in Antilia üòÇ\nLet‚Äôs start with what you mean by expectation. Doing a Google Search on the meaning of expectation will result in you this answer:\nexpectation: a strong belief that something will happen or be the case.\nComing back to the point, every time someone said this to me I always used to think ‚ÄúHow does expectation kill?‚Äù, ‚ÄúCan you ever stop expecting?‚Äù.\nWhy this blog? I have discussed this thing with almost all my friends over the years and it has helped me to had formed a really strong opinion about this.\nBut the idea of writing this as a blog came when Dheeraj said the comment mentioned below.\nThat's the think. You feel you have all the boxes checked, all the pre-requisites met and have everything it needs to get selected and all of a sudden‚Äî Bam! Rejected. So yeah, I expected to be selected, smooth as butter but quoting @tusharnankanii ‚Äî Expectations hurt anyways.\n‚Äî Dheeraj Lalwani (@DhiruCodes) September 13, 2022 Nothing wrong here but ‚ÄúExpectations hurt anyways.‚Äù, this line almost triggered me. Nothing against Tushar he might have a different experience than mine and if anyone of you readers wants to discuss this topic with me I‚Äôm always up for such discussion you can contact me on any of the mediums from links.darshanrander.com\nRoot cause The phrase ‚ÄúExpectation kills‚Äù is not something that I have heard from one or two people, it‚Äôs from almost all of them with whom I have talked about this topic.\nAgain a quick Google Search on ‚ÄúExpectation kills‚Äù will give a lot of articles, discussions and quotes. I read a few of them:\nWhy expectation kills happiness? Why does expectation kill? Whatever in it is not wrong, so what‚Äôs all the fuss about?\nAnd if you have guessed it. It‚Äôs not from Shakespeare.\nIn these times when the Internet is so cheap and our minds are so empty that we just take anything and everything that someone says and just believe it‚Äôs true without thinking about it for a second time.\nOver-expectation is a problem In the sea of all the ‚ÄúExpectation kills‚Äù I found this quote floating on top.\nThis is what I feel. You can never stop EXPECTING.\nLet‚Äôs take one of my favorite examples - You are not over-expecting when you think I should treat you in a good way. But you are over-expecting when you think that I should give you all my life‚Äôs savings (I don‚Äôt have any savings but you get the idea)\nNow while writing this blog I was talking to another friend about it and she said ‚ÄúI have experience with very low expectations disappointing¬†me‚Äù.\nSo, is expecting really a problem?\nExpectation vs Over-expectation ‚ÄúAtleast we can expect this from them?‚Äù, I‚Äôm sure everyone of us had said this in some or the other way. But can we decide what we can expect and cannot? Often we think that we are already expecting less from the other person. This is one of the main reasons why we get hurt.\nThe answer is not black or white here but I will try. So surely we can decide if we can expect something from someone but keeping in mind how strong your bond is from both ends and how the other person is.\nFor example - I can expect my bestfriend to listen to all my sad breakup stories (They enjoy the trauma in my life üòÇ). But at the same time, I cannot expect a stranger to do that for me.\nHere I know that my bestfriends care about me and they pretty much enjoy the trauma so I‚Äôm sure that they will listen. But a stranger might not want to hear all that negativity.\nSo calculate what you can expect and what you cannot. It‚Äôs always better to talk and understand the other side before assuming anything from their end.\nManaging expectations One of the most difficult tasks is managing your expectation. We already saw how difficult is to find a line between expectations and over-expectations as it varies from person to person and the bond you have with them. In short, there are too many variables to handle.\nI will not lie I don‚Äôt have the answer to how to manage expectations. The reason why it is difficult to manage your expectations you have to understand the other person and we all know that you can never truly understand someone. Whenever I thought that I truly understand this person. They managed to make me realize that I don‚Äôt.\nWe have to keep in mind that people change with time and situations, and they are not obligated to meet all our expectations.\nTalk about your expectations A lot of times the other person doesn‚Äôt have any idea if we are expecting anything from them. So we need to communicate it to them. We can‚Äôt just sit and expect them to understand what we want. We are over-expecting here.\nSo always convey your expectations to other people. But keep in mind that it‚Äôs not 100% guaranteed what they say is what they mean. They might just say things that you want to hear but would themselves never accept. They might do it because of multiple reasons but I feel it‚Äôs mostly because they don‚Äôt want to hurt your feelings, but that‚Äôs a topic for another blog.\nSo it‚Äôs better to let others have a margin of error where they fail to meet your expectations.\nAcceptance is the key Not expecting is not an option. In fact, You expect more from people who are close to you. I think that we are built in this way. Whatever lies we tell ourselves that we don‚Äôt expect anything from anyone but in the end subconsciously we expect a lot from others.\nFor example - Think about the last time when you felt sad because someone broke your expectations. Did you make those expectations consciously, no right?\nSo making those expectations is not in our hands, but what we can do is accept them and move on. People in our lives will always break our expectations, but we cannot lose a good bond just because we over-expected. The best solution is to accept it and forgive the other person.\nYou are not always over-expecting In the whole blog, we were talking about others and how we should manage our expectations with others. But often we forget about ourselves. The most important part of our lives is us. Not everytime you need to forgive others, sometimes it‚Äôs better to move on from that person and find someone who better understands you.\nBut when you will know that you are not over-expecting? In my opinion, it‚Äôs when you feel hard to forgive someone.\nHaving said that I should also mention that not everyone will have the same basic expectations. So try to help them understand what your basic expectations are and if see a cannot see a change after that then I feel it‚Äôs time to let them go.\nConclusion It has been a topic in my mind for a long time and I would never feel that I completely understand this topic but I have tried to share what I have learned and felt over the years.\nI‚Äôm sure that there might be some places where you will feel that I‚Äôm wrong about something. I would love to talk about you on this. Just ping me any of my social links.\nIn the end, I would say that managing expectations are very difficult but all you can do is try to understand others and if something goes wrong accept it and move on. But at the same time, you should know when it is enough.\nKeep learning, and always keep smiling
